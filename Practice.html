		<h3>Practice</h3>
		<p>
			<h4>
			Dao Dao designs buildings with the characteristics of a monster: unruly and romantic. 
			<br>
			Conceptually rooted in the spirit of revolution in architecture, we seek to break down the status quo and bring a little bit of chaos to the built environment. 
			<br>
			We work towards changing the perception of how architecture serves us and how we accept architecture. 
			<br>
			We do not hope it is merely a friendly one.
			<br>
			<br>
			We are remotely established in New York and Seoul.
			<br>
			We work at all scales. 
			<br>
			We occasionally write to keep ourselves alert.
